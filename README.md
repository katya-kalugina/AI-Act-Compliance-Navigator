## AI System Classifier

An algorithmic decision-support tool designed to classify AI systems in accordance with the the EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689).

[**📊 Run AI System Classifier **](https://ai-system-classifier-ywunrhw4gfav2mmzxx5jry.streamlit.app/)

### Project Overview
This tool converts the complex regulatory text of the EU AI Act into a functional logic tree. It enables users to determine the risk level of AI systems and identify specific mandatory obligations through a deterministic "Legal Engineering" approach.

### Key Regulatory Modules:
- Article 5 (prohibited Practices): identification of banned AI applications.
- Article 6 (high-Risk AI): classification logic for Annex I and Annex III systems, including the Article 6(3).
- Article 50 (transparency): assessment of disclosure obligations for chatbots, GenAI, deepfakes, and biometric systems.
- Articles 51-55 (GPAI models): classification of General-Purpose AI and assessment of systemic risk.

### Research Motivation:
In the field of **Responsible Computing**, abstract legal requirements must be translated into verifiable technical workflows. This project utilizes a "computational law" lens to reduce regulatory uncertainty and ensure **Accountability-by-Design**.

### Technical Implementation:
- **Architecture:** Rule-based deterministic logic engine.
- **Framework:** Python / Streamlit.
- **Source of Truth:** Official text of the European AI Office (Regulation 2024/1689).
