# EU AI Act Compliance Navigator

A deterministic decision-support tool designed to classify AI systems according to the legal criteria of the **EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689)**.

## Project Scope
This tool operationalizes the risk-based approach of the European AI regulation by converting complex legal articles into a functional logic tree. It focuses on:
- **Article 5:** Prohibited AI Practices.
- **Article 6 & Annex III:** High-Risk AI Classification.
- **Article 6(3):** Significant Risk Filter (Exceptions for auxiliary tasks).

## Use Case
This navigator is intended for Data Protection Officers (DPOs), AI Researchers, and Legal Engineers to perform early-stage compliance assessments. It ensures **Accountability-by-Design** by identifying regulatory obligations before deployment.

## Technical Implementation
- **Architecture:** Rule-based decision tree.
- **Framework:** Streamlit for interactive UI.
- **Source of Truth:** Official Journal of the European Union (Regulation 2024/1689).
